Hello everyone I've been long awaiting this review Canon's cheapest ticket to modern full frame goodness. 

## Why Canon
When I first knew I wanted to get into full frame photography the first set of camera bodies I looked into was the Canon 5d line up. At the time these cameras were just great for the money and honestly I knew a couple of friends that had experience with them so from there I went online and started doing a bunch of research on which version made sense for me at the time. My final choice ended up being the classic 5d. Not the 5d mark II or IV, just the plain old classic 5d. Fortunate enough for me ebay had a set for around 200usd with a cheap 50mm prime lens steal! With these I unknowly started my journey collecting high quality photos of everything in sight. From hikes taking pictures of flowers, to harrassing my friends for portraits, a true photographer was born or so I thought. This camera really took me to the next level though coming from the crop sensors and cheap bodies on Nikon's entry level dslrs like the D3200, thank goodness I got away from that thing. So naturally with Canon treating me so well right from the start I figured why waste anytime giving the competion a try? Can't lie though before the R8 I did spend some time learning videography with the Lumix G7, while a fun camera for filmamking I couldn't find much use for the thing in any sort of professional/high quality photography. Nontheless after some time researching I went with the R8 for the following reasons.

## For photography
The R8 as you would come to guess is indeed a full frame camera body. Coming in at 1500usd this gets you a 24.2 mega pixel CMOS sensor the same as the one in the much pricer R3 and if you know anything about that camera for the money that is indeed a steal. The photos come out pretty sharp and are deffenitly worthy of proffessional use or even an instagram post if that's your thing. The viewfinder is crisp and has never had me wishing for more when I'm out on a shoot even on a bright day, the screen however could be brighter and it does not have any ambient light sensors, some may see this as a con while others may like this desgin choice. As for the lens system Canons got you covered from the rf line up to adapters for the old ef lenes I personally did not have a collection of ef lenes worth me buying the adapter but it's something nice to have in the event ever needed. Shutter speed on this thing maxes out between 30 seconds and 1/4000s (or 1/16000s in electronic shutter) which is ideal for those quick bird shots, ISO tops out at 51200 I personally never get it up that high but it's there so need be which is nice to have for those low light situations. The only con I'd have for the R8 is no IBIS so make sure your lenes can some sort of OS or you're using a tripod of some sort.

## For videographers 
Canons been know to have great color science and the R8 is no exception. With clog-3 you can really get down and grade the footage, and if color grading isn't your thing the defualt color science is really beautiful and I find to be enough more often than not. The R8 records at 4K 30 oversampled from 6K and in my opinion you can get some real natgio vibes coming out of this thing. Auto focus is pretty fast when paired with some usm lenes but don't expect anything too crazy it does take a second at times even with the usm lenes, as far as the stm lenes don't just don't. What more can really be said about the R8 in terms of video this thing is a beast. Again only thing that's not here is the IBIS.
